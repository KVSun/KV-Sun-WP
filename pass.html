	<h2>Password update required</h2>
	<p>
		You may have noticed a few things different around here.
		<br/>
		This is the new website of the Kern Valley Sun, and it is still a work in
		progress. You can still read articles and view the E-Edtion, but things
		are quite a bit different behind the scenes.
		<br/><br/>
		As an unfortunate but necessary part of the transition to the new website,
		users will be required to change their passwords. We imported users from
		the old website but, for security reasons, we were not able to import your
		passwords.
		<br/><br/>
		Before you can login, you will need to update your password by clicking
		<a href="/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword">here</a>. Just enter the email
		address that you used to create your account and you will receive an email
		shortly with a link to update your password.
		<br/><br/>
		Sorry again about the inconvenience.
