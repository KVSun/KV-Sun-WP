	<h2>Password update required</h2>
	<p>
		You may have noticed a few things different around here.
		<br/>
		This is the new website of the Kern Valley Sun, and it is still a work in
		progress. You can still read articles and view the E-Edtion, but things
		are quite a bit different behind the scenes.
		<br/><br/>
		As an unfortunate but necessary part of the transition to the new website,
		users will be required to change their passwords. We imported users from
		the old website but, for security reasons, we were not able to import your
		passwords.
		<br/><br/>
		Before you can login, you will need to update your password by clicking
		<a href="/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword">here</a>. Just enter the email
		address that you used to create your account and you will receive an email
		shortly with a link to update your password.
		<br/><br/>
		Sorry again about the inconvenience.
		<br/>
	</p>
	<b>Update:</b><br/>
	<ins>
		It has been brought to our attention that most users who sign in are unable
		to view articles still. This is because, although accounts have been imported,
		subscription status is handled separately and needs to be updated.
		<br/><br/>
		We are aware of this problem and working to resolve it as soon as possible.
		<br/><br/>
		Some users are also having difficulties staying signed into the site. When
		signing in, please check the <q>Remember Me</q> checkbox to stay signed in.
		When returning, make sure to visit the secure version of the site, as user
		logins are not carried over to the insecure one. If the site you are visting
		or have bookmarked does not begin with <code>https://</code>, then you
		are viewing the insecure/unencrypted version of the site.
